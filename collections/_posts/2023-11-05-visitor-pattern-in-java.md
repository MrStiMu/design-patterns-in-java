description: "The Singleton pattern is a popular design pattern in Java that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is widely used in situations where there is a need for a single object to coordinate actions across the system. In Java, the Singleton pattern is implemented by defining a class with a private constructor and a static method that returns the instance of the class."
