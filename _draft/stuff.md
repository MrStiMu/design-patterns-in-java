Inheritance and Composition in Java
-----------------------------------

Inheritance and composition are two of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming. Both concepts help to reuse code and establish relationships between classes.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the superclass, while the class that is inheriting is called the subclass. The subclass can access all the public and protected methods and fields of the superclass. Inheritance is denoted by the keyword `extends`.

### Composition

Composition is another way to establish a relationship between classes in Java. In composition, a class contains an instance of another class as one of its fields. The class that contains the instance is called the composite class, while the class that is being contained is called the component class. Composition is denoted by declaring an instance of the component class as a field in the composite class.

### Differences between Inheritance and Composition

The main difference between inheritance and composition is that inheritance establishes an "is-a" relationship between the classes, while composition establishes a "has-a" relationship. Inheritance is used when the subclass is a more specialized version of the superclass, while composition is used when the composite class needs to use the functionality of the component class.

Inheritance can lead to tight coupling between the superclass and the subclass, making the code more difficult to maintain. On the other hand, composition allows for more flexibility and can lead to looser coupling between the composite class and the component class.

### Conclusion

Both inheritance and composition are important concepts in Java and can be used to establish relationships between classes. The choice between inheritance and composition depends on the specific use case and the relationship between the classes.



Understanding Design Patterns
-----------------------------

Design patterns are a set of proven solutions to common software engineering problems. They are commonly used to improve code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Design patterns provide a common vocabulary and a shared understanding of how to solve software engineering problems.

The concept of design patterns was introduced by the Gang of Four (GoF) in their book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". The book describes 23 design patterns that are classified into three categories: creational, structural, and behavioral.

Design patterns are not specific to any programming language or technology. They are general solutions to common software engineering problems that can be applied to any programming language or technology.

The Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently. The implementation of the Bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer composition over inheritance.

In software engineering, design patterns are often used to improve the quality of code, reduce the risk of introducing bugs, and make code more maintainable and scalable. Design patterns can also help developers to communicate more effectively by providing a common vocabulary and shared understanding of how to solve software engineering problems.
